## Accomodation


Rents are explosive here in the Valley. A family of 5 can live a luxary life in Turkey with the studio rent here!

During our first few weeks here we visited a lot of places and saw that natives are always relaxed and need lots of space. No one here likes to sleep in a single sized bed. Since everyone likes to sleep in a double sized bed, they assume 3 people are looking for a total of 6 person bed. What we need is a single room to just throw our stuff and sleep that’s all. But no! Even some of the hacker houses we’ve been to didn’t let 2 people sleep in a queen size bed. 

Anyway back to the subject, there are a few ways to stay in San Francisco for cheap (it is cheap in respect to other ways of living)

1. Hackerhouses: Downtown is usually around $1000-1200per month per person, a little out of the city you can find places for a little less. We are staying at [saddlehousesf](saddlehousesf.com) for $800 per person per month. 

2. Build your own hackerhouse: There are studios in tenderloin for under 2k and with water/wifi etc included it could go up to 2.3k a month. Put up 2 bunk beds(4 people) and voila, that’s $600 per pers per month. You can decrease the cost more if you are able to find more people and get a bigger house etc..

3. Student Places: I don’t know what to call them but they are usually $650 for 3 person rooms and $850 for 2 person rooms. The only problem with these places are they want some sort of a lease, each ones duration changes from 1 month to 12 months. And you usually have to book them 3 months in advance because there usually isn’t any space left. 

4. If you have a friend or find a startup whose willing to give you a couch, that is great, stop reading and just go there!

5. Craigslist: Okay there might be cheap stuff but it is freaking scary! I went to this house which was really nasty. There was an old woman who looked like a scary skeleton, there was enough space for the 3 of us and the price was really good. But man, I don’t think that woman was looking for people to rent her room to. She was looking at me like she was gonna eat/rape me or something. If I was a female and that women was a guy, something bad might have happened to me. So readers, if you are going to look at a place from craigslist beware and don’t go alone. Not to mention that 50% of the site is filled with scammers.

6. Being a professional homeless: Stay near the police station(safety), have a gym membership(hygiene), have tent & cooking stuff(sleep & eat) etc.. 

7. Couchsurfing (might not work, but heard stories)

8. Rent a RV (I have no idea how this will work out.. but hey.. it’s an idea)

9. If you say it’s okay for me to travel 1 hours everyday there are cheaper places at the east bay. But I haven’t researched them a lot so .. yea go figure them out on your own. I don’t want to waste a lot of time everyday. 

Btw usually places are leased for 12 months and if it is 6 or 3 months the price goes up almost 2x.
So all in all accommodation here sucks, but you get to meet a lot of people & see different cultures while trying to find the right place.
Remember that I said everyone here needed 2 person beds? Well there is a hacker house which almost does the opposite. Since asians are used to 12 people staying in a one room house, it doesn’t bother them to do the same here.
All in all, I am sure that you’ll find a place for yourself if you search hard enough.

## Talking To Foreigners



Last year when I visited the US people told me that companies liked outsourcing to countries like Turkey & Ukraine instead of India & China, they said that language was a big barrier but I didn’t actually get how big of a barrier it was until today. 

So I’m at this meetup talking to people etc. It’s all going well and I saw this asian cool looking kid and shook hands with him. The first thing I asked was his name and he responded “juan” I repeated back “juan?” he said no “tuan” I repeated back “tuan?” he said no “huan” I repeated back “huan?” he said no ”blabla”, and I was like, okay okay fuck it I’m Demir nice to meet you. So .. what do you do? Then he said “m a asa syonts” then I sad huh? He repeated “aya sa syonts” this went on for another 3 times until I understood what he was saying. Dammit man, learn how to pronounce what you are doing!!! Turns out, he was a data scientist...

I had a similar thing with an Indian later on.. So people if you are going to another country to network & stuff please make sure you can pronounce the basics of your shit!

## Cleanliness Tap


![Cleanliness Tap](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vsVrf3_pDj0/T3ZYCMkKciI/AAAAAAAAAOo/5YHVfGzL_DQ/s400/taharet-muslugu_282664.jpg "Cleanliness Tap")


In Turkey, toilets have a sprayer in the back when turned on sprays water to the area and then you can dry it with a toilet paper. 

Cleaning your butt after doing your business works differently here. Imagine not having any toilet paper. That’s how you can imagine us not having any water to clean our butts. Paper towel only works to some degree. What if the poop is a little fluid? What if it is completely fluid, you’d have to use a lot of toilet paper to get it clean and that doesn’t even clean as good as water. So our solution was to arrange a time to shit and then shower. Either it was going to be in the morning or before bedtime. So we did that. And it worked really well. Though there are also other options to get it completely cleaned. 
You can get the toilet paper a little wet and use it. Then dry it with another toilet paper which is better than just using dry toilet paper. 
So to those who are coming from cultures who value the cleanliness of their butts a little more should prepare themselves for a small but easily overcomeable challenge.

## Unexpected Benefit of Hackerhouses


Only online gamers will understand what this is about. Remember the time when a friend is leaving the server, never going to play again? Either he drops all of his items on the floor for everyone to take or just gives them to a good friend. Well in our case Alan was going back to his country for a few months and while leaving he left lots of kitchen supplies. He basically gave us a week worth of food. So thanks Alan for giving us your items. We hope you have a safe trip back home.

## Process Explanation Trumps Execution


Airport, bank, mall, car rental etc. every place we went to explained the process before doing anything. People stop doing what they are doing, they explain you all the steps you are going to have to take, one by one, slowly and only after that, they start executing. Even when the [clipper card](https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/index.do)(a card used to pay bus & train fares) machine didn’t work the woman first took time to explain the process instead of just trying to use the machine. 

In most of the countries I've been to, no one ever explains anything. They just tell you what to do at the time and you usually have no idea what’s going on and what is gonna happen. The upside is that things gets done in a faster way. Though I think that keeping a balance between process explanation & execution is probably the healthiest thing to do. 

Now we understand why [YC] (http://www.ycombinator.com/) keeps saying “Just do it”. Here people talk more about how and what they are going to do instead of just doing it.
